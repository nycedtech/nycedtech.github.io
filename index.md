New York City has an incredible ecosystem of nonprofits that work with students learning how to code. Across hundreds of organizations, nonprofits, and educational institutions that span K-12, college, and post-college, there are more opportunities than ever here in New York City #yas.

We also know that what helps these organizations thrive is working closely with tech industry -- specifically engaging the thousands of founders, developers, operators and more at technology companies here in NYC, who mentor, volunteer, and give time back to these organizations. 

There are so many great ways to engage on tech education, including:
* Speaking at Events
* Mentorship
* Code Review
* Hack Days & Judging 
* Job Shadow
* Recruitment & Internship Opportunities
* Donating Workspace

This open database is intended to be the go-to, central, one-stop place for:
* Nonprofits and organizations to list specific opportunities for tech industry to get involved
* Tech companies throughout NYC to have visibility to engage and support great organizations.

This directory is open-source. Any organization or individual can add and update their opportunities and point(s)-of-contact.
